# **Java Core Programming Practice Repository**

## Overview

This repository documents my journey of mastering core Java programming concepts through solving a comprehensive set of 150 practice questions. The questions are sourced from a structured Java programming course syllabus, covering fundamental to advanced topics. The goal is to enhance my understanding and proficiency in Java by implementing solutions to each problem, organized by course modules.

## Objectives

- **Master Core Java Concepts**: Gain a deep understanding of Java syntax, object-oriented programming, collections, exception handling, multithreading, and advanced features like generics, lambda expressions, and JDBC.
- **Apply Problem-Solving Skills**: Implement practical solutions to real-world programming problems, ranging from basic to complex scenarios.
- **Document Learning Progress**: Maintain a well-organized repository with clear, maintainable code and detailed explanations for each solution.
- **Showcase Proficiency**: Create a portfolio of Java programming skills for professional and educational purposes.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories corresponding to the six modules outlined in the course syllabus. Each module contains subdirectories for individual practice questions, with solutions implemented in Java.

- **Module 1: Introduction to Java**
  - Basic syntax, data types, operators, control statements, loops, arrays, and string operations.
  - Example: Programs to print "Hello, Java!", perform arithmetic operations, and implement sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort.
- **Module 2: Object-Oriented Programming in Java**
  - Classes, objects, constructors, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, abstract classes, and interfaces.
  - Example: Designing a `Car` class with encapsulation and creating a class hierarchy for `Vehicle` -&gt; `TwoWheeler` -&gt; `Motorcycle`.
- **Module 3: Java Collections Framework**
  - Working with `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`, `HashSet`, `TreeSet`, `HashMap`, `TreeMap`, iterators, and sorting mechanisms.
  - Example: Sorting custom objects using `Comparable` and `Comparator`, and finding word frequencies using `HashMap`.
- **Module 4: Exception Handling and I/O**
  - Exception handling with try-catch, custom exceptions, file operations, and serialization.
  - Example: Reading/writing files using `BufferedReader` and `FileWriter`, and handling `ArithmeticException`.
- **Module 5: Multithreading and Concurrency**
  - Thread creation, synchronization, thread pooling, and concurrency utilities like `ReentrantLock` and `ExecutorService`.
  - Example: Implementing a Producer-Consumer problem and demonstrating thread synchronization.
- **Module 6: Advanced Java Basics**
  - Generics, lambda expressions, Stream API, annotations, reflection, and JDBC for database connectivity.
  - Example: Using Stream API to process collections and connecting to a database using JDBC for CRUD operations.

Each question is implemented in a separate `.java` file, named according to the module and question number (e.g., `M1_Q01_HelloJava.java`). Solutions include comments explaining the logic, and where applicable, conceptual explanations are provided for clarity.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Navigate Modules**: Browse the module directories to explore specific topics or questions.
2. **Run Solutions**: Each Java file is a standalone program that can be compiled and executed using a Java Development Kit (JDK). Ensure JDK is installed and configured.
   - Compile: `javac ModuleX/MX_QYY_*.java`
   - Run: `java ModuleX.MX_QYY_*`
3. **Review Comments**: Each solution includes inline comments to explain the code's functionality and approach.
4. **Contribute or Learn**: Feel free to fork this repository, suggest improvements, or use it as a learning resource.

## Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 8 or higher is recommended to support advanced features like lambda expressions and Stream API.
- **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**: IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or any preferred IDE for compiling and running Java programs.
- **Basic Knowledge**: Familiarity with Java syntax and programming concepts is helpful but not mandatory, as solutions are self-explanatory.

## Learning Outcomes

By completing the 150 practice questions, I aim to achieve the following:

- **CO1**: Understand and recall Java's core features and syntax.
- **CO2**: Explain and implement object-oriented programming principles.
- **CO3**: Apply Java Collections Framework, exception handling, and file I/O effectively.
- **CO4**: Analyze and resolve concurrency issues in multithreaded applications.
- **CO5**: Develop complex Java applications using advanced features like generics and JDBC.

## Future Plans

- Add unit tests for solutions to ensure correctness and robustness.
- Implement mini-projects (e.g., Library Management System, Multithreaded Chat Application) to apply concepts holistically.
- Include performance benchmarks for algorithms (e.g., sorting, searching) to compare efficiency.
- Expand documentation with detailed explanations of complex topics like reflection and concurrency.

## Acknowledgments

This repository is inspired by the structured practice set from the Java Programming course syllabus. The questions are designed to align with the course objectives, ensuring a comprehensive learning experience.
