# Write a program that uses ReentrantLock from java.util.concurrent.locks for explicit locking instead of synchronized keyword. [High]

```java

import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

class Counter {
    private int count = 0;
    private final ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();

    // Increment with explicit locking
    public void increment() {
        lock.lock(); // acquire lock
        try {
            count++;
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " incremented count to: " + count);
        } finally {
            lock.unlock(); 
        }
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}

class Worker extends Thread {
    private final Counter counter;

    public Worker(Counter counter, String name) {
        super(name);
        this.counter = counter;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            counter.increment();
            try {
                Thread.sleep(200); // simulate work
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
}

public class ReentrantLockDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Counter counter = new Counter();

        Thread t1 = new Worker(counter, "Worker-1");
        Thread t2 = new Worker(counter, "Worker-2");

        t1.start();
        t2.start();

        try {
            t1.join();
            t2.join();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        System.out.println("Final Count: " + counter.getCount());
    }
}


```

## Expected Output (order may vary due to thread scheduling):

```java

Worker-1 incremented count to: 1
Worker-2 incremented count to: 2
Worker-1 incremented count to: 3
Worker-2 incremented count to: 4
...
Final Count: 10

```
