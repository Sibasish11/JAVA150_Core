# Write a program to demonstrate join() method. Create two threads, where the main thread waits for the completion of another thread before continuing. [Medium]

```java


- The join() method ensures that one thread waits for the completion 
  of another thread before proceeding further.
- This is useful when you want the main thread to wait until 
  another thread finishes its execution.

In this example:
- WorkerThread prints messages with some delay.
- The main thread uses join() to wait until WorkerThread completes
  before printing its own message.


class WorkerThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
            System.out.println("Worker thread: Task " + i);
            try {
                Thread.sleep(1000); // simulate work
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                System.out.println("Worker thread interrupted.");
            }
        }
        System.out.println("Worker thread finished.");
    }
}

public class JoinDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        WorkerThread t1 = new WorkerThread();
        t1.start();

        try {
            // Main thread waits for t1 to complete
            t1.join();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            System.out.println("Main thread interrupted.");
        }

        System.out.println("Main thread continues after Worker thread finishes.");
    }
}


```

## Output:

```java

Worker thread: Task 1
Worker thread: Task 2
Worker thread: Task 3
Worker thread finished.
Main thread continues after Worker thread finishes.

```
