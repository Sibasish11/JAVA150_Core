# Write a program to create a new thread by extending the Thread class. The thread should print a message multiple times. [Low]

## âœ… Example Output (thread execution order may vary):

```
Hello from MyThread! Count: 1
Hello from Main Thread! Count: 1
Hello from MyThread! Count: 2
Hello from Main Thread! Count: 2
Hello from MyThread! Count: 3
Hello from Main Thread! Count: 3
Hello from MyThread! Count: 4
Hello from Main Thread! Count: 4
Hello from MyThread! Count: 5
Hello from Main Thread! Count: 5
