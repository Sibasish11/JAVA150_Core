THREAD STATES IN JAVA


In Java, a thread goes through several **life cycle states** defined in the Thread.State enum.

1. NEW
   - A thread is created but not yet started using start().
   - Example:
        Thread t = new Thread();
        // t is in NEW state here.

2. RUNNABLE
   - After calling start(), the thread is ready to run.
   - It's placed in the runnable pool, waiting for the CPU scheduler to pick it.
   - Note: It may not be running immediately, just eligible to run.

3. RUNNING
   - The thread scheduler picks the thread from the runnable pool and gives CPU time.
   - Only one thread per CPU core can be in the RUNNING state at a time.

4. BLOCKED
   - A thread is waiting to acquire a monitor lock (e.g., entering a synchronized block/method).
   - It is temporarily inactive until the lock is released by another thread.

5. WAITING
   - A thread is waiting indefinitely until another thread signals it using notify() or notifyAll().
   - Example:
        synchronized(obj) {
            obj.wait(); // moves thread into WAITING
        }

6. TIMED_WAITING
   - A thread is waiting for a specified amount of time.
   - Methods like sleep(milliseconds), join(milliseconds), or wait(milliseconds) put a thread here.
   - After the time expires, it returns to RUNNABLE.

7. TERMINATED
   - A thread finishes execution and cannot be restarted.
   - Example:
        t.start(); // valid
        t.start(); // throws IllegalThreadStateException once terminated

SUMMARY:

- NEW → RUNNABLE → RUNNING → (WAITING / TIMED_WAITING / BLOCKED) → RUNNABLE → RUNNING → TERMINATED
- Some states (WAITING, TIMED_WAITING, BLOCKED) are intermediate holding states before resuming execution.
- TERMINATED is the final state.
```

```java

public class ThreadStatesExplanation {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Thread states explained in comments. (See source code)");
    }
}
