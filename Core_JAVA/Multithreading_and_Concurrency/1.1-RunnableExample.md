# Write a program to create a new thread by implementing the Runnable interface. The thread should print a message multiple times. [Low]

```java

class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            System.out.println("Hello from Runnable Thread! Count: " + i);
            try {
                Thread.sleep(500); // pause for 500ms for better visibility
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                System.err.println("Runnable thread interrupted: " + e.getMessage());
            }
        }
    }
}

public class RunnableExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        MyRunnable myTask = new MyRunnable();

        Thread t = new Thread(myTask);

        t.start();

        // Main thread printing messages
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            System.out.println("Hello from Main Thread! Count: " + i);
            try {
                Thread.sleep(500); // pause for 500ms
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                System.err.println("Main thread interrupted: " + e.getMessage());
            }
        }
    }
}


```

## âœ… Example Output (order may vary because of concurrency):

```
Hello from Runnable Thread! Count: 1
Hello from Main Thread! Count: 1
Hello from Runnable Thread! Count: 2
Hello from Main Thread! Count: 2
Hello from Runnable Thread! Count: 3
Hello from Main Thread! Count: 3
Hello from Runnable Thread! Count: 4
Hello from Main Thread! Count: 4
Hello from Runnable Thread! Count: 5
Hello from Main Thread! Count: 5
```

# ðŸ”‘ Key Difference vs. Extending Thread:

- Thread class â†’ direct inheritance (cannot extend another class).

- Runnable interface â†’ more flexible (a class can still extend another class).
