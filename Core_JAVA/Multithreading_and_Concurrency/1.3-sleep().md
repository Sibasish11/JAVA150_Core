# Write a program to demonstrate the sleep() method. Create a thread that pauses for a few seconds. [Low]

```java

- The sleep() method is used to pause the execution of a thread 
  for a specified number of milliseconds.
- During sleep, the thread does not lose ownership of any monitors (locks).
- InterruptedException must be handled because sleep() is a checked exception.

class SleepThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            System.out.println("Message " + i + " from thread.");
            try {
                // Pause thread for 2 seconds (2000 ms)
                Thread.sleep(2000);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                System.out.println("Thread interrupted: " + e.getMessage());
            }
        }
    }
}

public class SleepDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SleepThread t = new SleepThread();
        t.start();
    }
}


```
