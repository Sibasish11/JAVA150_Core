# Compare and contrast creating threads using Thread class vs. Runnable interface. Discuss which is generally preferred and why. (Conceptual, in comments). [Medium]

1. Creating Thread by extending Thread class:
   - You create a class that extends `Thread`.
   - Override the `run()` method and place the thread logic inside it.
   - Example:
        class MyThread extends Thread {
            public void run() {
                System.out.println("Thread running...");
            }
        }
        new MyThread().start();

   - Limitation: Since Java only supports single inheritance, 
     if your class extends `Thread`, it cannot extend any other class.

2. Creating Thread by implementing Runnable interface:
   - You create a class that implements `Runnable`.
   - Implement the `run()` method with thread logic.
   - Pass an instance of Runnable to a Thread object.
   - Example:
        class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
            public void run() {
                System.out.println("Runnable thread running...");
            }
        }
        new Thread(new MyRunnable()).start();

   - Advantage: Your class can still extend another class, because you are only 
     implementing an interface (Java allows multiple interface implementations).

Key Differences:

   Thread Class    -----   Runnable Interface
     
   - Inherits Thread directly            - Implements Runnable, passed to Thread
   - Cannot extend other classes         - Allows extending other classes
   - Simpler to write for quick use      - More flexible and widely used
   - Tightly couples task with thread    - Separates task (Runnable) from execution (Thread)


Which is generally preferred and why?

âœ” Using Runnable is generally preferred because:
   - It promotes better object-oriented design (separates task logic from thread management).
   - It allows a class to extend another class if needed (flexibility).
   - It is commonly used in frameworks and thread pools (ExecutorService, etc.).

Conclusion:
- Use `Thread` class when writing very small/simple threads.
- Prefer `Runnable` for larger applications, reusability, and better design.

```java

public class ThreadVsRunnable {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("See comments above for conceptual explanation.");
    }
}

```
