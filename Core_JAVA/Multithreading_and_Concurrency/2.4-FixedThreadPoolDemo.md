# Write a program to use ExecutorService to execute a fixed number of tasks concurrently. [Medium]

```java

import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;

class MyTask implements Runnable {
    private final int taskId;

    public MyTask(int taskId) {
        this.taskId = taskId;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Task " + taskId + " is running on " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
        try {
            Thread.sleep(1000); // simulate some work
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }
        System.out.println("Task " + taskId + " completed by " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}

public class FixedThreadPoolDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a thread pool with 3 threads
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);

        // Submit 5 tasks
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            executor.execute(new MyTask(i));
        }

        // Shutdown executor after submitting tasks
        executor.shutdown();
        try {
            if (!executor.awaitTermination(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {
                executor.shutdownNow();
            }
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            executor.shutdownNow();
        }

        System.out.println("All tasks finished.");
    }
}


```

## Output:

```java

Task 1 is running on pool-1-thread-1
Task 2 is running on pool-1-thread-2
Task 3 is running on pool-1-thread-3
Task 1 completed by pool-1-thread-1
Task 4 is running on pool-1-thread-1
Task 2 completed by pool-1-thread-2
Task 5 is running on pool-1-thread-2
Task 3 completed by pool-1-thread-3
Task 4 completed by pool-1-thread-1
Task 5 completed by pool-1-thread-2
All tasks finished.

```
