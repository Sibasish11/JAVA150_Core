# Implement a program that uses CountDownLatch to make one or more threads wait until a set of operations being performed in other threads completes. [High]

```java

import java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch;

class Worker extends Thread {
    private CountDownLatch latch;
    private int workerId;

    public Worker(int workerId, CountDownLatch latch) {
        this.workerId = workerId;
        this.latch = latch;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        try {
            System.out.println("Worker " + workerId + " started working.");
            Thread.sleep(1000 * workerId); // Simulate work
            System.out.println("Worker " + workerId + " finished work.");
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } finally {
            latch.countDown(); // Decrease latch count
        }
    }
}

public class CountDownLatchExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int numberOfWorkers = 3;
        CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(numberOfWorkers);

        // Start worker threads
        for (int i = 1; i <= numberOfWorkers; i++) {
            new Worker(i, latch).start();
        }

        System.out.println("Main thread is waiting for workers to finish...");

        try {
            latch.await(); // Wait until latch count becomes 0
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        System.out.println("All workers finished. Main thread proceeds.");
    }
}


```

### Sample Output:

```java

Main thread is waiting for workers to finish...
Worker 1 started working.
Worker 2 started working.
Worker 3 started working.
Worker 1 finished work.
Worker 2 finished work.
Worker 3 finished work.
All workers finished. Main thread proceeds.

```
