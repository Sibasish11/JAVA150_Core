# Implement a ThreadPoolExecutor to manage a pool of threads for executing a set of tasks. [High]

```java

import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
import java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;

class Task implements Runnable {
    private final int taskId;

    public Task(int taskId) {
        this.taskId = taskId;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Task " + taskId + " started by " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
        try {
            // Simulate some work
            Thread.sleep(2000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        System.out.println("Task " + taskId + " finished by " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}

public class ThreadPoolExecutorDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a thread pool with 3 threads
        ThreadPoolExecutor executor = (ThreadPoolExecutor) Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);

        // Submit 6 tasks
        for (int i = 1; i <= 6; i++) {
            executor.execute(new Task(i));
        }

        // Initiate shutdown after all tasks are submitted
        executor.shutdown();

        try {
            // Wait for all tasks to finish (with timeout)
            if (!executor.awaitTermination(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {
                executor.shutdownNow(); // force shutdown if tasks take too long
            }
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            executor.shutdownNow();
        }

        System.out.println("All tasks completed. Executor shut down.");
    }
}


```

# Output:

```java

Task 1 started by pool-1-thread-1
Task 2 started by pool-1-thread-2
Task 3 started by pool-1-thread-3
Task 1 finished by pool-1-thread-1
Task 4 started by pool-1-thread-1
Task 2 finished by pool-1-thread-2
Task 5 started by pool-1-thread-2
Task 3 finished by pool-1-thread-3
Task 6 started by pool-1-thread-3
Task 4 finished by pool-1-thread-1
Task 5 finished by pool-1-thread-2
Task 6 finished by pool-1-thread-3
All tasks completed. Executor shut down.
