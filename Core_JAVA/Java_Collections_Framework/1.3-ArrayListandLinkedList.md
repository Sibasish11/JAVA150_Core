# Compare and contrast ArrayList and LinkedList in terms of internal implementation, performance for random access vs. insertions/deletions, and memory usage. (Conceptual, in comments). [Medium]

```java

/*
 Compare and Contrast ArrayList and LinkedList

 1. Internal Implementation:
    - ArrayList: 
      → Uses a dynamic array internally.
      → Elements are stored in contiguous memory locations.
    - LinkedList:
      → Uses a doubly linked list internally.
      → Each node stores data + references to previous and next nodes.

 2. Performance:
    - Random Access:
      → ArrayList: O(1) time complexity (direct index-based access).
      → LinkedList: O(n) time complexity (needs traversal from head/tail).
    
    - Insertions/Deletions:
      → ArrayList: O(n) in worst case for middle operations (elements shift).
      → LinkedList: O(1) for middle operations after reaching the node 
                    (only pointers updated), 
                    but reaching the node itself is O(n).

 3. Memory Usage:
    - ArrayList: Less memory overhead, stores only data.
    - LinkedList: Higher memory overhead, each node stores two extra references (prev, next).

 Summary:
    - Use ArrayList → when frequent random access is required and fewer insert/delete operations in the middle.
    - Use LinkedList → when frequent insertions/deletions in the middle are needed, and random access is less important.
