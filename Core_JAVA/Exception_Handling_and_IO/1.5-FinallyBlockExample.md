# Write a program that uses a finally block to ensure a resource (e.g., a file stream) is closed, regardless of whether an exception occurred. [Medium]

```java

import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FinallyBlockExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FileWriter writer = null;

        try {

            writer = new FileWriter("output.txt");
            writer.write("Hello, this text is written to the file!");

            if (true) {
                throw new RuntimeException("Something went wrong while writing!");
            }

        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("IOException occurred: " + e.getMessage());
        } catch (RuntimeException e) {
            System.out.println("RuntimeException occurred: " + e.getMessage());
        } finally {

            try {
                if (writer != null) {
                    writer.close();
                    System.out.println("FileWriter closed successfully in finally block.");
                }
            } catch (IOException e) {
                System.out.println("Error while closing FileWriter: " + e.getMessage());
            }
        }

        System.out.println("Program continues after finally block...");
    }
}

```

## Expected Output:

```java 

RuntimeException occurred: Something went wrong while writing!
FileWriter closed successfully in finally block.
Program continues after finally block...

```
