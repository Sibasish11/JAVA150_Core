# Write a program that uses a finally block to ensure a resource (e.g., a file stream) is closed, regardless of whether an exception occurred. [Medium]

```java

import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FinallyBlockDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FileWriter writer = null;

        try {
            
            writer = new FileWriter("output.txt");
            writer.write("Hello, this is a test message!");
            
           
            int result = 10 / 0; // ArithmeticException

        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            System.out.println("Caught ArithmeticException: " + e.getMessage());
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("Caught IOException: " + e.getMessage());
        } finally {
          
            try {
                if (writer != null) {
                    writer.close();
                    System.out.println("FileWriter closed successfully.");
                }
            } catch (IOException e) {
                System.out.println("Error while closing FileWriter: " + e.getMessage());
            }
            System.out.println("Finally block executed.");
        }

        System.out.println("Program continues...");
    }
}


```

## Output:

```java

Caught ArithmeticException: / by zero
FileWriter closed successfully.
Finally block executed.
Program continues...

```
