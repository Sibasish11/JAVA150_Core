# Write a program to read characters from console input using BufferedReader and write them to a file. [Medium]

```java

import java.io.*;

public class ConsoleToFile {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String filename = "console_output.txt"; // Output file

        try (
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
            FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(filename)
        ) {
            System.out.println("Enter text (type 'exit' to finish):");

            String line;
            while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {
                if (line.equalsIgnoreCase("exit")) {
                    break; // Stop input
                }
                fw.write(line + System.lineSeparator()); // Write to file
            }

            System.out.println("Input has been written to " + filename);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

```

- BufferedReader wraps InputStreamReader(System.in) to read input from the console.

- User types text â†’ it is written to console_output.txt.

- If the user types exit, the program stops taking input.

- FileWriter ensures text is written line by line.


### Example Run:

```java
Enter text (type 'exit' to finish):
Hello
This is a test
exit
Input has been written to console_output.txt
```

### ðŸ“„ console_output.txt will contain:

```java
Hello
This is a test
```
