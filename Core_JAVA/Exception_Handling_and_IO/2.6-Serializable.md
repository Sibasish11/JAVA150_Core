# Write a program to demonstrate object serialization. Create a simple Student class (must implement Serializable), create an object, serialize it to a file, and then deserialize it back into an object. [High]

```java

import java.io.*;


class Student implements Serializable {
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L; 
    private int id;
    private String name;

    public Student(int id, String name) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
    }

    public void display() {
        System.out.println("Student ID: " + id + ", Name: " + name);
    }
}

public class SerializationDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String filename = "student.ser"; // File where object will be stored

        Student student = new Student(101, "Alice");

        try (ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(filename))) {
            oos.writeObject(student);
            System.out.println("Student object has been serialized and saved to " + filename);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        try (ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(new FileInputStream(filename))) {
            Student deserializedStudent = (Student) ois.readObject();
            System.out.println("Student object has been deserialized:");
            deserializedStudent.display();
        } catch (IOException | ClassNotFoundException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}


```

## Output:

```java

Student object has been serialized and saved to student.ser
Student object has been deserialized:
Student ID: 101, Name: Alice

```
