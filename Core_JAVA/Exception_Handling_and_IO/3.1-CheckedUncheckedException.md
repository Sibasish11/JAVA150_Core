Difference between Checked and Unchecked Exceptions in Java
 
1. Checked Exceptions:
   - These are exceptions that are checked at compile-time.
   - The compiler forces the programmer to either handle them using try-catch
     or declare them using the `throws` keyword.
   - Examples: IOException, SQLException, ClassNotFoundException.
   - Usage: When the error is expected and can be recovered (e.g., 
     file not found, database connection issues).
   - Example:
        try {
            FileReader fr = new FileReader("file.txt"); // May throw FileNotFoundException
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

2. Unchecked Exceptions:
   - These are exceptions that occur at runtime and are not checked at compile-time.
   - They are subclasses of RuntimeException.
   - Examples: NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, ArithmeticException.
   - Usage: When the error is due to programming mistakes that 
     usually cannot be recovered (e.g., accessing null, dividing by zero).
   - Example:
        int[] arr = new int[3];
        System.out.println(arr[5]); // Throws ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException at runtime

 Summary:
 
 - Checked exceptions → Checked at compile-time, must be handled or declared.
 - Unchecked exceptions → Occur at runtime, not enforced by compiler.
 - Best practice:
     * Use checked exceptions for recoverable conditions (file, network, database).
     * Use unchecked exceptions for programming logic errors (null access, invalid index).
