# Write a program using JDBC to delete a record from the Students table based on id. [Medium]

## üîπ Steps:
1. Connect to database (SQLite here).
2. Use PreparedStatement with DELETE query.
3. Delete a student by their ID.


```java

import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.PreparedStatement;
import java.sql.SQLException;

public class JDBCDeleteExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // SQLite database connection URL
        String url = "jdbc:sqlite:test.db";

        // SQL delete query
        String sql = "DELETE FROM Students WHERE id = ?";

        try (Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(url);
             PreparedStatement pstmt = conn.prepareStatement(sql)) {

            // Example: Delete record with id=3
            pstmt.setInt(1, 3);

            int rowsAffected = pstmt.executeUpdate();

            if (rowsAffected > 0) {
                System.out.println("‚úÖ Record deleted successfully.");
            } else {
                System.out.println("‚ö†Ô∏è No record found with given ID.");
            }

        } catch (SQLException e) {
            System.out.println("‚ùå Error deleting record!");
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

```

## ‚úÖ Expected Output:

If record with id=3 existed:

```
‚úÖ Record deleted successfully.
```
