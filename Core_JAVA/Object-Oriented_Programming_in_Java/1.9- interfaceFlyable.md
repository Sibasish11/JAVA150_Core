# Create an interface Flyable with a method fly(). Make a Bird class implement Flyable and a Plane class implement Flyable. Demonstrate interface usage. [Medium]

```java

interface Flyable {
    void fly();
}

class Bird implements Flyable {
    @Override
    public void fly() {
        System.out.println("The bird flaps its wings and soars in the sky!");
    }
}

class Plane implements Flyable {
    @Override
    public void fly() {
        System.out.println("The plane speeds down the runway and takes off!");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Flyable bird = new Bird();
        Flyable plane = new Plane();

        // Demonstrating interface usage through polymorphism
        bird.fly();
        plane.fly();
    }
}


```

### Output:

```java

The bird flaps its wings and soars in the sky!
The plane speeds down the runway and takes off!


```
