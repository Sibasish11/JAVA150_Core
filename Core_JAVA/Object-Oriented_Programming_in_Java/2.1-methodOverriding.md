# Discuss method overriding. Provide an example where a subclass overrides a method from its superclass. [Low]


### Method Overriding
### Method overriding in Java occurs when a subclass provides its own implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass with the same name, parameters, and return type.
### It is a type of runtime polymorphism.

```java

class Animal {
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal a = new Animal();  
        Animal b = new Dog();    

        a.sound();
        b.sound(); 
    }
}

```

### Output:

```java
Animal makes a sound
Dog barks

```
