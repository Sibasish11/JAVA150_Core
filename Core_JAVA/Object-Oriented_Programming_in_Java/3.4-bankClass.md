# Design a simple Bank class with methods deposit and withdraw that modify an account balance. Handle invalid operations (e.g., withdrawing more than balance). [Medium]

```java

class Bank {
    private double balance;

    public Bank(double initialBalance) {
        if (initialBalance < 0) {
            System.out.println("Initial balance cannot be negative. Setting balance to 0.");
            this.balance = 0;
        } else {
            this.balance = initialBalance;
        }
    }

    public void deposit(double amount) {
        if (amount <= 0) {
            System.out.println("Deposit amount must be positive.");
        } else {
            balance += amount;
            System.out.println("Deposited: ₹" + amount + " | New Balance: ₹" + balance);
        }
    }

    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        if (amount <= 0) {
            System.out.println("Withdrawal amount must be positive.");
        } else if (amount > balance) {
            System.out.println("Insufficient balance! Available balance: ₹" + balance);
        } else {
            balance -= amount;
            System.out.println("Withdrew: ₹" + amount + " | New Balance: ₹" + balance);
        }
    }

    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Bank account = new Bank(5000);

        account.deposit(1500);   // Valid deposit
        account.withdraw(2000); // Valid withdrawal
        account.withdraw(6000); // Invalid: Insufficient balance
        account.deposit(-500);  // Invalid: Negative deposit
        account.withdraw(-100); // Invalid: Negative withdrawal

        System.out.println("Final Balance: ₹" + account.getBalance());
    }
}


```

## Output:

```java

Deposited: ₹1500.0 | New Balance: ₹6500.0
Withdrew: ₹2000.0 | New Balance: ₹4500.0
Insufficient balance! Available balance: ₹4500.0
Deposit amount must be positive.
Withdrawal amount must be positive.
Final Balance: ₹4500.0


```
