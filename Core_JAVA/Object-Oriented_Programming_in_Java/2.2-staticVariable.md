# Create a class Counter with a static variable count initialized to 0. Increment count in the constructor. Demonstrate that count keeps track of the number of objects created. [Medium]

```java

class Counter {
    static int count = 0;

    public Counter() {
        count++;
        System.out.println("Object created. Total count: " + count);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Counter c1 = new Counter();
        Counter c2 = new Counter();
        Counter c3 = new Counter();

        System.out.println("Final count: " + Counter.count);
    }
}


```

### Output:

```java

Object created. Total count: 1
Object created. Total count: 2
Object created. Total count: 3
Final count: 3


```
