# Discuss the difference between interface and abstract class in terms of multiple inheritance, fields, and constructors. (Conceptual, in comments). [Medium]

/*
    Difference between Interface and Abstract Class in Java:

    1. Multiple Inheritance:
       - Interface: Supports multiple inheritance. 
         A class can implement multiple interfaces.
         Example: class MyClass implements Interface1, Interface2 { }
       - Abstract Class: Does NOT support multiple inheritance (only single inheritance).
         A class can extend only one abstract class.

    2. Fields:
       - Interface: Can have only public static final constants (i.e., implicitly 'public static final').
         No instance variables allowed.
       - Abstract Class: Can have instance variables, static variables, and constants.

    3. Constructors:
       - Interface: Cannot have constructors (cannot be instantiated directly).
       - Abstract Class: Can have constructors (used to initialize common fields).

    4. Method Types:
       - Interface: Methods are implicitly public and abstract (Java 8+ allows default and static methods, Java 9+ allows private methods).
       - Abstract Class: Can have abstract methods (without body) and concrete methods (with body).

    5. Usage:
       - Interface: Defines a contract for classes to implement, ideal for capability-like behavior (e.g., Flyable, Runnable).
       - Abstract Class: Provides a base for related classes with common state and behavior.

interface Flyable {
    void fly(); 
}

abstract class Bird {
    String name;

    Bird(String name) { 
        this.name = name;
    }

    abstract void makeSound(); 
}

class Sparrow extends Bird implements Flyable {
    Sparrow(String name) {
        super(name); 
    }

    public void fly() { 
        System.out.println(name + " is flying");
    }

    void makeSound() { 
        System.out.println(name + " chirps");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Sparrow sp = new Sparrow("Jack");
        sp.fly();
        sp.makeSound();
    }
}

```

## Output:

```java
Jack is flying
Jack chirps

```
